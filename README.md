# CS213: Object-Oriented Programming - Assignment 3

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts using C++ through the development of various board games. The assignment emphasizes core software engineering principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, templates, recursion, and code reuse.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Game Variants Implemented:**
  - **Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe:** A unique variant with a triangular game board where players win by getting three-in-a-row.
  - **Four-in-a-Row:** A 7x6 grid-based game inspired by Connect Four, requiring players to form a row of four Xs or Os.
  - **5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe:** A large grid version where players compete for the most three-in-a-row sequences.
- **Modular Design:** Object-oriented architecture separating game logic into classes for better maintainability.
- **Smart AI Player:** Implemented an AI using backtracking and heuristic algorithms for enhanced gameplay.
- **Code Review:** Comprehensive peer review for code quality and maintainability.

## 📚 Concepts Utilized
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
- Recursion and backtracking algorithms
- Software design patterns for reusable and modular code
